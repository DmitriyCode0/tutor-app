# Mobile Calendar Indicator Fix Summary

## Problem
- On mobile devices, lesson indicators ("R" for recurring, "Paid" for paid lessons) were stretching across the entire lesson cell instead of appearing in their designated corners
- This was caused by CSS rules that set `left: 2px`, `right: 2px`, `top: 2px`, `bottom: 2px` for all mobile lesson indicators

## Solution
Updated `/styles/TimeSlotCell.css` with proper positioning:

### Mobile Calendar (.mobile-calendar) - 768px breakpoint:
- **Recurring "R" indicator**: `top: 2px; right: 2px; left: auto; bottom: auto;`
- **"Paid" indicator**: `bottom: 2px; left: 2px; right: auto; top: auto;`  
- **Tips indicator**: `bottom: 2px; right: 2px; left: auto; top: auto;`

### General Mobile Styles (768px breakpoint):
- **Recurring "R" indicator**: `top: 3px; right: 3px; left: auto; bottom: auto;`
- **"Paid" indicator**: `bottom: 3px; left: 3px; right: auto; top: auto;`
- **Tips indicator**: `bottom: 3px; right: 3px; left: auto; top: auto;`

## Key Changes
1. Removed problematic `left: Xpx; right: Xpx; top: Xpx; bottom: Xpx;` from base `.lesson-indicator` rules
2. Added explicit `auto` values to reset unwanted positioning properties
3. Ensured each indicator type has specific corner positioning

## Testing
- Desktop view: Indicators work as before (no changes to desktop behavior)
- Mobile view (< 768px): Indicators now appear only in their designated corners
- Responsive design: Smooth transition between desktop and mobile layouts

## Result
✅ Recurring "R" mark appears only in top-right corner
✅ "Paid" mark appears only in bottom-left corner  
✅ Tips amount appears only in bottom-right corner
✅ No more overlapping with main lesson content
